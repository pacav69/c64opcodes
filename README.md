# c64opcodes

This is a "WORK IN PROGRESS" extension For VSCode. It displays a Webview page with detailed information on 6502/6510 opcodes. To execute the extension run the command `Open C64 Opcodes List` from the command pallete. If the cursor is on an opcode when run, that opcodes detailed information will be displayed, otherwise the extensions menu page will load allowing you to browse the opcode lists.

Note: The opcode text does not need to be selected, simply place the cursor on the opcode then run the command

Currently all normal opcodes are completed. (Still need to add Illegal Opcodes) so the extension is usable in it's current state.
